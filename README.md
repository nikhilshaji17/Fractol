# Fract'ol

## Project Description

**Fract'ol** is a graphical program that generates and visualizes fractals, such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, using the C programming language. The project focuses on interactive fractal exploration through zooming, panning, and coloring techniques, with a strong emphasis on mathematical concepts and graphical rendering.

## Objective

The objective of the Fract'ol project is to create an interactive fractal viewer where users can visualize different types of fractals, zoom into them, and interact with the fractals through mouse and keyboard events. The program should allow users to generate at least one type of fractal, such as the Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, and explore these fractals with various customization options. 

## Complexity and Challenges

The complexities of this project include:

- **Mathematical Concepts:** Understanding and applying the mathematical concepts behind fractals, including complex numbers, iterative calculations, and escape-time algorithms.

- **Graphics Programming:** Implementing graphical rendering with low-level graphics libraries (like MinilibX) to display the fractals efficiently on the screen.

- **Interactive Interface:** Handling user interactions, including zooming, panning, and switching between different fractals using mouse and keyboard events.

- **Optimization:** Optimizing the fractal generation algorithm to handle high-resolution rendering, deep zooming, and large iterations without significant performance degradation.

- **Memory Management:** Efficiently managing memory when working with large sets of pixels and complex data structures for fractal calculations.

## Skills and Competencies Gained

This project teaches certain skills, including:

- **Mathematical Modeling:** Gaining a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts like complex numbers, iteration, and fractals, and applying them to a real-world problem.

- **Graphics Programming:** Learning how to use graphics libraries, such as MinilibX, for rendering images, handling pixels, and creating interactive programs.

- **C Programming:** Developing in C to implement low-level graphical manipulations, handle input/output, and manage resources efficiently.

- **User Interface Design:** Implementing interactive elements like zooming, panning, and fractal type selection, as well as handling user inputs through the mouse and keyboard.

- **Performance Optimization:** Implementing algorithms that efficiently calculate fractals and display them at high resolution, particularly when zooming in or rendering complex fractals.

- **Problem-Solving and Debugging:** The project requires analytical thinking to efficiently calculate and display fractals, while also debugging and optimizing code to ensure smooth performance and correct mathematical behavior.
