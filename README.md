# Fract'ol

## Project Description

**Fract'ol** is a graphical program to generate and visualize fractals like the Mandelbrot and Julia sets in C. It allows users to interact with the fractals by zooming, panning, and changing colors.

## Objective

Create an interactive fractal viewer that allows users to generate fractals, zoom in, pan across, and customize the visualization. The program should support at least the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

## Complexity and Challenges

The complexities of this project include:

- **Mathematical Concepts:** Understanding and implementing fractal generation through iterative complex number calculations.

- **Graphics Programming:** Using libraries (like MinilibX) to render fractals and handle pixel data efficiently.

- **Interactive Interface:** Implementing zooming, panning, and switching between fractals using mouse and keyboard.

- **Optimization:** Ensuring smooth performance when rendering high-resolution fractals or zooming deeply.

- **Memory Management:** Efficiently handling memory for large fractal images and iterations.

## Skills and Competencies Gained

This project teaches certain skills, including:

- **Mathematical Modeling:** Applying complex numbers and fractals to solve real-world problems.

- **Graphics Programming:** Using MinilibX to render and manipulate images.

- **C Programming:** Mastering low-level programming, handling memory, and efficient data management.

- **User Interface Design:** Creating an interactive interface for user input and customization.

- **Performance Optimization:** Writing efficient code to handle high-detail fractal rendering.
